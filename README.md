IT 230 Course Registration System
What This Project Does
This project is a course registration system I built for IT 230. It allows students to register for IT courses, shows which courses they've picked, and makes sure they don't sign up for the same course twice or take too many credits.
The system includes:
A WPF (Windows) version with a graphical interface
A Console version that works with text commands
A debugging exercise showing how I fixed code problems
Project Requirements
The registration system needed to:
Show a list of IT courses students can choose from
Not let students register for the same course twice
Limit students to 9 total credit hours (3 courses)
Tell students if they make a mistake
Show which courses they're already registered for
Keep track of their total credits
These features help students register for courses without errors and keep track of what they've selected.
Debugging and Coding Approach
Added error checking - The system catches all possible mistakes (like trying to register twice)
Created clear error messages - Students know exactly what went wrong
Organized my code - I separated the code into logical parts that are easy to understand
Fixed bugs systematically - I found and fixed problems one by one in a logical order
Conclusion
This portfolio demonstrates my ability to work with existing code, implement changes based on requirements, and develop new software solutions. The projects showcase technical skills in C# programming, WPF application development, console application design, debugging, and applying user-centered design principles. Through these implementations, I've demonstrated problem-solving capabilities, attention to detail, and a methodical approach to software development.
